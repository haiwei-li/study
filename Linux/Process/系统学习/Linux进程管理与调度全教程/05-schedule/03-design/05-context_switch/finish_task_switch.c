/**
 * finish_task_switch - clean up after a task-switch
 * @prev: the thread we just switched away from.
 *
 * finish_task_switch must be called after the context switch, paired
 * with a prepare_task_switch call before the context switch.
 * finish_task_switch will reconcile locking set up by prepare_task_switch,
 * and do any other architecture-specific cleanup actions.
 *
 * Note that we may have delayed dropping an mm in context_switch(). If
 * so, we finish that here outside of the runqueue lock. (Doing it
 * with the lock held can cause deadlocks; see schedule() for
 * details.)
 *
 * The context switch have flipped the stack from under us and restored the
 * local variables which were saved when this task called schedule() in the
 * past. prev == current is still correct but we need to recalculate this_rq
 * because prev may have moved to another CPU.
