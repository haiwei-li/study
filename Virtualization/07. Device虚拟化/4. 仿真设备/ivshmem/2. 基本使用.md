> ./configure --enable-kvm --disable-xen --disable-strip --disable-sdl --enable-vhost-net --disable-debug-tcg --target-list=x86_64-softmmu

基本语法:

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -device ivshmem-plain,memdev=hostmem
```

`hostmem` 定义了一个 host 上的 memory backend. 对于一个 POSIX 共享内存后端, 类似:

```
-object memory-backend-file,size=1M,share=true,mem-path=/dev/shm/ivshmem,id=hostmem

-object memory-backend-file,size=1M,share,mem-path=/dev/shm/ivshmem,id=hostmem
```

IVSHMEM 测试代码:

启动 ivshmem-server

```
# build/contrib/ivshmem-server/ivshmem-server -l 4M -M fg-doorbell -n 8 -F -v
*** Example code, do not use in production ***
Using POSIX shared memory: fg-doorbell
create & bind socket /tmp/ivshmem_socket
```



使用 client 占据 peer id 0:

```
./contrib/ivshmem-client/ivshmem-client
dump: dump peers (including us)
int <peer> <vector>: notify one vector on a peer
int <peer> all: notify all vectors of a peer
int all: notify all vectors of all peers (excepting us)
cmd> listen on server socket 3

cmd> dump
our_id = 0
  vector 0 is enabled (fd=5)
  vector 1 is enabled (fd=6)
  vector 2 is enabled (fd=7)
  vector 3 is enabled (fd=8)
  vector 4 is enabled (fd=9)
  vector 5 is enabled (fd=10)
  vector 6 is enabled (fd=11)
  vector 7 is enabled (fd=12)
```

> 对 client 而言, server 的 socket fd 是 3;
>
> 然后它自己有 8 个向量(server 决定的), 每个向量一个 fd(5 ~ 12)

ivshmem-server 增加 log

```
accept()=5
new peer id = 0
peer->sock_fd=5
```

> 新增了 peer(0), 其 sock_fd 是 5, `peer->sock_fd` 是通过 `accept()` 得到的, server 通过这个与 peer 通信.

qemu 仅仅增加 ivshmem_doorbell 设备

```
-chardev socket,path=/tmp/ivshmem_socket,id=fg-doorbell
-device ivshmem-doorbell,chardev=fg-doorbell,vectors=8
```

qemu 打印 log 如下(打开 `#define IVSHMEM_DEBUG 1`)

```

ivshmem server 增加 log:

```
accept()=14
new peer id = 1
peer->sock_fd=5
peer->sock_fd=14
```

> 看到新增了 peer(1), 其 socket_fd 是 14, 后面打印了所有 peer 的 fd

ivshmem client dump 如下:

```
cmd> dump

  vector 0 is enabled (fd=5)
  vector 1 is enabled (fd=6)
  vector 2 is enabled (fd=7)
  vector 3 is enabled (fd=8)
  vector 4 is enabled (fd=9)
  vector 5 is enabled (fd=10)
  vector 6 is enabled (fd=11)
  vector 7 is enabled (fd=12)
peer_id = 1
  vector 0 is enabled (fd=13)
  vector 1 is enabled (fd=14)
  vector 2 is enabled (fd=15)
  vector 3 is enabled (fd=16)
  vector 4 is enabled (fd=17)
  vector 5 is enabled (fd=18)
  vector 6 is enabled (fd=19)
  vector 7 is enabled (fd=20)
```

vm 关机, server log

```
peer->sock_fd=5
peer->sock_fd=14
free peer 1
```
